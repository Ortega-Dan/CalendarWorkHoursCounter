  <h3>Calendar Hours Counter</h3>
  <ul style="min-width: 350px;">
    <li>Alt + I: Current Day Hours Passed and Diff (with estimated finishing time).</li>
    <li>Alt + K: Count Week Hours Passed and Diff to Week-so-far (with optional filter for different days according to
      presented instructions).</li>
    <li>Add Shift key to the previous options to count all visible events and not only those that have passed or
      started (evaluates for entire week [not just week so far] if passed for the week option. Use Ctrl + K if you want
      actual Hours Passed against the entire Week).</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: darkblue;">Works on Google Calendar for personal and enterprise versions, with English (US) language,
    and United States country settings, and counts events for the account main calendar, and not the ones from external
    or additional calendars.
  </p>
  <p style="color: darkblue;">It works in Week view of the calendar<br>
    (Switch to week view by hitting "w" key [Which is google-calendar's shortcut]).</p>

  <p>It compares against 8 hours for current-day, and counts hours for the entire week for empty queries.</p>
  <p>To ignore events write cal.ignore (or c.ig) somewhere in the event title, separated from the rest of the text
    by some space or any other non-text character (any character distinct to numbers, letters, or underscore).
    <br><i>It also ignores automatically all declined and tentative-attendance ("maybe") events.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    To insert an activity prefix in an event title, set the following boxes and use the corresponding shortcut while
    editing:
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="first">Alt + J</label><br>
    <input id="first"
           type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="second">Alt + L</label><br>
    <input id="second"
           type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="fourth">Alt + H</label><br>
    <input id="fourth"
           type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="third">Alt + U</label><br>
    <input id="third"
           type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="fifth">Alt + N</label><br>
    <input id="fifth"
           type="text">
  </div>
  <div class="activity">
    <label for="sixth">Alt + M</label><br>
    <input id="sixth"
           type="text">
  </div>

  </p>
  <i>
    To generate hours reports, out of the exported iCalendar (ics file) from Google Calendar settings, it is
    recommended to prefix events with the format "<span style="color: darkblue;">CLIENT: Project, </span>" where both
    "CLIENT" and "Project" are made of ASCII letters, numbers, or underscore.<br>
    The report can be generated by using BasicICSreader from: <a
